## Usage

All scripts can be run from the project root directory:

```bash
# Download template files (if needed)
bash setup/download_files.sh

```

## Notes

- Scripts automatically handle relative paths from the project root
- The `pixi.toml` file is generated from the template and is gitignored
- All setup files are version controlled in this directory
